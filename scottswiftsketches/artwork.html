            Here is the artwork I have created. Some of it was for a class and some of it was for my family or friends. Growing up I never considered that I myself would have a relationship with art. That relationship started by me needing an outlet for my emotions after the passing of my brother. I started by playing D&D, which progressed to painting minis and then drawing what my characters would look like. I have found a passion for graphic design and using my love for computers to make the artwork I that expresses what I think and feel in the moment.
