      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        A place where I can display my graphic design portfolio. The homepage will show a mix of some of my favorite designs and allow friends, family, clients and employers to view different pages that are dedicated to certain design styles. The reason that my audience will come to my website and not any other is because it will be the website that gets in contact with me. I canâ€™t promise that they will choose me over another graphic designer but the attractive parts of my website will be its pleasing aesthetic and ease of use. The customers, friends, and family will be able to easily navigate and view the different pieces on the page.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        What does his artwork look like? Is he experienced? How much will it cost to commission a logo or design? Are there any reviews of his work? Why should I choose him over another graphic artist? Does his style align with my view of how the commission should turn out? What kind of service can I expect from him? Are there different design packages? I will also have a page detailing the cost of my services. How much just a logo will cost versus how much a full ad would cost? Are revisions allowed, if so, how much more would a revision cost? How long will it take for the project? It will also detail how the transfer of ownership will work. It is important to set expectations and limits. If not, a client will take much more of your time than they are paying you for. In order to lay things out clearly I will need to have detailed information about what each design package would contain. One of the things the customer will need to do on my website is to decide which design package would get them the best return on their investment. That is why it is important that I show what kind of work I can do so that they would trust me with their investment. Some things that customers would like to do on my website are: fill out contact information.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        See what kind of artwork I have created. Find links to my social media. They will need to know how to navigate between the different pages. They will also need to know where to request information. There should also be an about me page so that they can get to know me. The About Me page will be like a resume. It will talk about my education and previous work experience. There will be a couple of pages that display my ad work and my logo work as well as some other artwork that I create. I want these to look like a gallery that the users can scroll through. The different galleries will be accessible through the navigation panel on the side of the screen. When you click an image, it will get larger so that it can be inspected. Across the home screen, there should be a slideshow of some of my favorite designs. I want to include reviews or positive feedback as a quote on the slide show as well.
