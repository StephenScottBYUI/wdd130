      <h3>Artwork</h3>
      <p>
        Here is the artwork I have created. Some of it was for a class and some of it was for my family or friends. Growing up I never considered that I myself would have a relationship with art. That relationship started by me needing an outlet for my emotions after the passing of my brother. I started by playing D&D, which progressed to painting minis and then drawing what my characters would look like. I have found a passion for graphic design and using my love for computers to make the artwork I that expresses what I think and feel in the moment.

      <h3>Logo Designs</h3>
      <p>
        Logo design is my main interest with graphic design. I love the idea of creating the face of company. This is an area that I will keep growing in and studying. I want to find out how to create something so iconic that it will forever be related to a successful company.

      </ul>
      <h3>Advertisements</h3>
      <p>
        I think a highlight of my career would be to create a full page advertisement for a prolific brand. Something where I created the whole thing. The artwork, the typography, the layout. The trust a company would have to put in me is immense. Right now this page is filled with some artwork that could have been an advertisement. The typography poster was an assignment I had in class to create an advertisement that showcased the font I had chosen. I had so much fun playing with heirchy of the size of the fonts. Having the viewer follow the lines of a pyramid everywhere they looked. It is one of the compositions that I am most proud of.
