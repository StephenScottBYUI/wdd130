            I think a highlight of my career would be to create a full page advertisement for a prolific brand. Something where I created the whole thing. The artwork, the typography, the layout. The trust a company would have to put in me is immense. Right now this page is filled with some artwork that could have been an advertisement. The typography poster was an assignment I had in class to create an advertisement that showcased the font I had chosen. I had so much fun playing with heirchy of the size of the fonts. Having the viewer follow the lines of a pyramid everywhere they looked. It is one of the compositions that I am most proud of.
